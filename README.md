# Krusty Krab Website

Welcome to the Krusty Krab website where I introduce you to the characters working in the restuarant, the food and lastly providing you the opportunity to work with us!

p.s If you look carefully you might find the button the the secret recipe ;-)

<!-- One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. -->

## Design Process

I got this idea from ordering food and watching a clip on Spongebob. After doing so I thought why not make a website for the well-known Krusty Krab of Bikini Bottom?

I started with the navigation bar where I wanted it to look as simple and efficient as possible so users wouldn't get lost when browsing on the website.

After that I moved on to the homepage where it instantly tells the user what page they are on by introducing the title of the place through the header, and the location through the background.

About introduces the workers in Krusty Krabs where users can learn more about their potential future co-workers\* (coming up soon in later explanations). I also plan to add buttons so users could click on it to learn more about the characters beyond what is shown.

Menu shows users what can be ordered at Krusty Krabs

Contact allows the users to apply to work at Krusty Krabs

TLDR: Straight-forward design so user wouldn't get confused while exploring.

<!-- Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process.
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.  -->

## Features

<!-- In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. -->

### Existing Features

Navigation Bar - By clicking on the logo of Spongebob it brings user back to homepage. If the website width size is less than 575px it becomes adds dropdown feature.

About - Shows the workers and characters to user where they can hover over their card and it lights up. Read More button leads to their wiki page where in-depth history and description of the characters are explained.

Contact - Allows the user to contact Krusty Krab and apply for a job there by filling in the form.

<!-- - Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future: -->

### Features Left to Implement

\*Home - Plan on adding an invisible button on the background image door where it lights up upon hover, where users could navigate to the about section through this extra feature.

\*Menu - Plan on adding a button at the bottom of the page where it says "Secret Recipe". Upon clicking it would lead to another page where it will mock Plankton and RickRoll the user.

\*About - Plan on adding and action page after user clicks submit.

## Technologies Used

I used IonIcons for my dropdown icon

<!-- In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation. -->

## Testing

1. Navigation Bar:

   1. Go to any page
   2. Decrease the screen size below width of 575px and verify that an dropdown icon shows up
   3. Try to click on dropdown icon and verify that the different navigators works upon interaction by bringing user to respective pages.

2. About:
   1. Go to "About" page
   2. Try to hover over each character and verify that they respond by enlarging and changes colors of text and background.
   3. Try to click on "READ MORE" and verify that it opens a new tab to their respective wikipedia page
   4. Try to make the screen smaller and verify that the character cards moves below on its own.

<!-- For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->
